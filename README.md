# `API Extraction` 
> * Seventh app is A simple contacts card using `randomuser.org` api
Refreshing the page just reloads the page new used data. for this app I used 2 react Js APIs one is `axios` that is a `promise` based HTTP client for browser and node. And another is a third party api for generating random user. I have just implemented get request in this project.`

## Concepts learn -->
> * `async and await` --> setState is asynchronous inside event handlers.
> * This ensures, for example, that if both Parent and Child call setState during a click event, Child isn’t re-rendered twice. Instead, React “flushes” the state updates at the end of the browser event. This results in significant performance improvements in larger apps.
> * but React update `this.state` synchronously
> * `Await` --> The await operator is used to wait for a Promise
